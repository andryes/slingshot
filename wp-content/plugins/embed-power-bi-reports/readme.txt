**Row-level security (RLS) with Power BI**

Support of row-level security (RLS) for restricting PowerBI data access to your users. Filters restrict PowerBI data access at the row level, and you can define filters within roles.

Row Level Security in Power BI is a data governance capability of Power BI that restricts data based on the authorization context of the logged-in user. RLS forms an integral part of an organization’s data protection strategy as it implements appropriate data visibility for end-users. Power BI Row Level Security ensures that end users have visibility only into the data of Power BI they are supposed to see. Inappropriate access management can lead to chaos and unforeseen circumstances in any organization.

Row Level Security in Power BI is a way to protect sensitive data by limiting visibility access to Power BI data and reports. Row Level Security Power BI is a horizontal limitation applied to rows within a table. Power BI applies filters on the data for the users with limited visibility based on the instructions outlined by the administrator. The filters in Power BI apply data access limitations at the row level, and these filters can be defined within roles.

**Power BI Row Level Security Use Cases :**

Implementing Row Level Security in Power BI is a must if your dataset includes sensitive information (for example, information related to company financial accounts, customer information, or patient information). Below-mentioned is a list of the Row Level Security use cases seen across many organizations.

*   **Location-based RLS in Power BI**: When the company wants a user to only view information within a specific area or location (City/State/Country).
Employee-based RLS in Power BI: When the company wants an employee to only view information pertaining to his job responsibility. For example, a Store Manager should only view information related to the store’s business.

*   **Business Line-based RLS in Power BI**: When the company wants a user to only view information within a specific business line (Product/Service/Unit).

*   **Other RLS in Power BI**: Apart from the above-mentioned use cases, RLS can also be implemented with respect to Time (Month/Year), Customer (Specific Customer/Group of Customers), etc.

Power BI is all about Data Analytics, Data Visualization, and Business Intelligence. It is used by Data Professionals all over the world to examine data from multiple sources and create attractive Charts, Dashboards, and Reports according to user-specified data. However, it is quite necessary to protect sensitive Power BI data and one of the best practices to do so is by implementing Power BI Row Level Security (RLS).
